### Project Information
- Navbar is made by using Bootstrap5, HTML & CSS,
- Display property of some elements change according to screen size,
- Namely phone numbers and "#clarusway" elements' display is none for xs and sm screens, 
- "#clarusway" elements' display becomes inline-block at md screens,
- phone number elements' display becomes inline-block at lg screens.



------
I used;
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap5





## Lesson Learned

- Bootstrap is a rich CSS library. It's possible to make some HTML elements make invisible or visible according to screen size. Bootstrap classnames can be used for this purpose (for example: d-none or d-md-inline-block)
